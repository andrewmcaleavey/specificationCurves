# specificationCurves

The goal of specificationCurves is to provide functions for flexible applications of specification curves to diverse data.  

This project is currently in development and obviously not finished. I don't recommend you use it except if you want to extend it on your own.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of `specificationCurves` from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
# requires the {devtools} package to be installed already
library(devtools)
install_github("andrewmcaleavey/specificationCurves")
```

## Example

The most common application at present is through `run_multiple_trims()`:

``` r
library(specificationCurves)
## 
run_multiple_trims(sim_dat)
```

You can contact me (Andrew McAleavey) with any questions or suggestions.
